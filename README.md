# Perception System - Autonomous Vehicles
An AI based PyTorch implementation of a Perception System.


## Description:
Two AI Models capable of predicting the 3d bounding boxes of objects around the ego vehicle is being developed.
The First Model predicts the bounding boxes from just the image data from the surrounding cameras and the Second Models predicts the bounding boxes from the image and pointcloud data from the camera and radar sensors around the vehicle.
